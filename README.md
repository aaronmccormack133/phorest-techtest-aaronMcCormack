Phorest Techtest Assessment - Aaron McCormack

<h1> Todo: </h1>

<h2> Web Application </h2>

1. ~~Find/Search for clients (GET /clients) using either email or phone number~~

    1.  ~~Should be able to handle when there are many of the same clients returned~~ 

2. Create Voucher for given customer returned from search (using clientId POST /voucher)

    1.  ~~Should allow you to input the amount the voucher is created for~~
    
    
Spring Boot application is able to consume information from the API using search of email and phone number. 
A post request is able to be made to the same server with the balance added but was unable to retrieve the id
from the model passed. 

The UI is bootstrapped in order to look more user friendly. 

Had I put more time to it I would have completed the POST request properly and constructed tests using JUnit.

The image was built into a docker container.
